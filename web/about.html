		<h2 style="text-align: left;">About</h2>
		<h4 style="max-width: 700px;">
			Campfyre is an online message board that allows anyone to post without having to worry about accounts or passwords. Campfyre also limits posts and comments to 256 characters to ensure a quick discussion platform.<br/><br/>

			Campfyre uses 'robofaces' to make following posts easier. These faces are generated based on a hash of your IP address. Every IP address has a roboface so if someone posts/comments from the same location more than once they will (usually) have the same roboface.<br/><br/>

			The frontpage of Campfyre includes every post with the exception of posts tagged with '#bonfyre' and posts marked as offensive/nsfw (unless you have chosen to see those posts) in chronological order.<br/><br/>

			<h4 style="max-width: 700px;">
				<strong>What is the point of this site?</strong><br/>
				Fun.<br/>

				<br/><strong>Who is in charge here?</strong><br/>
				Me (<a target="_blank" href="http://nick.geek.nz">Nick Webster</a>) but I've had help from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jj56">Jamie McClymont</a>.<br/>

				<br/><strong>Why 256 characters?</strong><br/>
				Why not?<br/>
				In all seriousness 140 chars isn't enough and 256 is a fun computing number (2<sup>8</sup>)<br/>

				<br/><strong>Is Campfyre open source?</strong><br/>
				It wasn't at first, but it is now. <a href="https://github.com/NickGeek/Campfyre">Fork us on GitHub!</a><br/>

				<br/><strong>What font is this?</strong><br/>
				It's called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato">Lato</a>.<br/>

				<br/><strong>Where are all the old posts?</strong><br/>
				Go to the bottom of the page and click the "Load More" button, you can go back to the first post ever.<br/>

				<br/><strong>Why do all the old posts not have comments?</strong><br/>
				They all died in a fire. The SQL db of all the old comments is linked to <a target="_blank" href="http://campfyre.org/permalink.html?id=93">here</a>. The IDs of the posts they relate to is off though. You can also try using the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140518031051/http://campfyre.org/">wayback machine</a> to read old comments.<br/>

				<br/><strong>What's up with the time on old posts?</strong><br/>
				The time since posted was added after Campfyre started. Every post before time was added is listed as the time I added time.<br/>

				<br/><strong>Can I swear?</strong><br/>
				Yes; I'm not your mum.<br/>

				<br/><strong>Can I have a username?</strong><br/>
				No.<br/>

				<br/><strong>I found XX post really offensive! Can you delete it?</strong><br/>
				No. I will mark the post as offensive so only users who want to see offensive posts will see it. If you are choosing to see offensive posts don't freak out when you see them.<br/>

				<br/><strong>You're literally Hitler!</strong><br/>
				You're literally Polpot.<br/>

				<br/><strong>Wtf is a tilde tag?</strong><br/>
				Something that's never going to happen... NEVER! <span style="font-size: 40%;">#rebellion<br/>
