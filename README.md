Campfyre
========

Campfyre is an online message board that allows anyone to post without having to worry about accounts or passwords. Campfyre also limits posts and comments to 256 characters to ensure a quick discussion platform.

Campfyre hasn't been available on the web since the end of 2015. That may be changing soon.
